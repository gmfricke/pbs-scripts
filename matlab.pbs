## PBS submission script to run a batch MATLAB script on CARC machines

# these are the pbs directives. They are just options to qsub, written here 
# for convenience. They are overwritten by any given to qsub on command line

#PBS -l nodes=1:ppn=8
#PBS -l walltime=01:00:00
#PBS -N matlab_test
#PBS -S /bin/bash

# matlab script must end in .m but do not include the .m here:
# ie for hello.m only hello is written (-r option to matlab is used)
INPUT=hello   
OUTPUT=out.log

# shouldn't need to edit below here often

# must load the module
module load matlab

#change to directory where you typed qsub
cd $PBS_O_WORKDIR

#These type of lines will be in the STDOUT file (ie .o)
echo starting Matlab jobs at $(date)

# Call matlab on your code and redirect output to OUTPUT
matlab -r -nojvm -nodisplay $INPUT > $OUTPUT

# also in .o
echo finished Matlab jobs at $(date)

# better timing info can be found my prepending /usr/bin/time to matlab command
# see man time for more info
