## Basic Common Linux Commands

Linux is amazingly powerful. As with most powerful tools there is a learning curve, but it is actually a fairly mild one. In order to use CARC supercomputers you will need to learn a few basic commands to read, write, copy and remove files, create, copy and remove directories, and understand the file tree and where you are in it. The following is a reference sheet for the most basic commands, but again, Linux is extremely powerful and learning details beyond the basics will allow you to be more a efficient, happy and productive computational scientist.
